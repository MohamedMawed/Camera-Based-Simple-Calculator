•	Camera-based Simple Calculator :-
User input a picture of an equation (printed formula), and then the application processes the image and returns the calculation result. Operators in the equation can be:  + – * / ^ ( ).
Used Algorithms
1.	Segmentation algorithm (connected components , color segmentation)
2.	Fourier Descriptors 
3.	Simple Shape Descriptors (Major Axis , Minor Axis)
4.	Some Good Descriptive Statistics.
  Accuracy 
    1.	94% without Image noise.
    2.	85% with image Enhancement.
  Role 
    1.	The hole Project implemented by me.
